last modified February 28, 2021. 21w08a.

Subcommands are keywords that have their own options, seperate from the main auto-editor program. They typically serve an auxillary function.

Syntax:

```
auto-editor {subcommand} {*options}
```

Examples:

```
auto-editor info example.mp4
```

```
auto-editor generate_test --fps 25
```


List of subcommands currently avaiable:

  1. info
  1. test
  1. generate_test
